# HaeBin by imnotkind
a pure raw request bin

## Three Tiny Steps

1. Create a new Bin
2. Send any http request to your bin
3. Check your requests in the bin!

## Motive

Fiddler, Postman, Postbin, Requestbin...  

Those scams show some pretty information, but a real request doesn't look like that...Â 

Sometimes I want to feel the pure, naked request itself... 

**Back to the basics...**
